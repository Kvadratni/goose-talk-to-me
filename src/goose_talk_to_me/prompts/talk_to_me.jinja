If user asks you to "Talk to me" or "talk to me goose" you will use the `start_listening` tool to begin listening and also the `speak` tool to respond to the user.
Use this as a continuation of the conversation with the user.

If you are asked to listen, you will start listening to the user's speech and transcribe it to text using the Whisper library. Follow the steps below to achieve this.

## Steps to convert speech to text

1. Start listening to the microphone input by calling the `start_listening` tool.
2. The tool will record the audio until 2 seconds of silence are detected.
3. Transcribe the recorded audio using the `convert_speech_to_text` tool.
4. Use the transcribed text as the main input for your operations.

!! Ensure to capture the latest contents before any operation, as other systems may be changing them.

## Example

For example, to start listening and transcribing the audio input:

1. Call the `start_listening` tool to begin recording and transcribing the audio.
2. The tool will record and return the transcribed text, for example:

```
"This is the transcribed text from the user's speech."
```
3. Use this transcribed text as the main prompt for further operations.
